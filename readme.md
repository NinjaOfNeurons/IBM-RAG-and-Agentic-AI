# IBM RAG & Agentic AI – Learning Repository

This repository documents my learning journey from the **IBM RAG and Agentic AI course**.

The course explores how to build intelligent AI systems using:

* **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
* Agentic workflows and autonomous AI agents
* Prompt engineering and orchestration
* Tool integration and memory handling
* Real-world enterprise AI use cases

## 📌 What You’ll Find Here

* Notes and key concepts
* Hands-on labs and experiments
* Code examples
* Mini-projects and implementations
* Reflections and insights

## 🎯 Goal

To build practical knowledge in designing and deploying RAG-based and Agentic AI systems using modern AI frameworks and tools.
