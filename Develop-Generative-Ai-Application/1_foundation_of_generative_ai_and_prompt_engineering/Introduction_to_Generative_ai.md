# Develop Generative AI Applications – Getting Started

## 1. Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (AI)

**Artificial Intelligence (AI)** is the simulation of human intelligence by machines.
AI systems are designed to perform tasks such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, and decision-making.

### Types of AI

AI can be broadly categorized into:

1. **Discriminative AI**

   * Classifies or predicts outcomes based on input data.
   * Example: Spam detection, image classification.

2. **Generative AI**

   * Creates new content based on learned patterns from training data.
   * Example: Text generation, image creation.

## 2. What is Generative AI?

Generative AI models create new content based on patterns learned from large datasets.

### How It Works

* Requires an **input prompt**
* Generates an **output**
* The input can be:

  * Text
  * Image
  * Audio
  * Video
  * Code
  * Structured data

### Output Formats

Depending on training data, outputs can be:

* Text
* Images
* Audio
* Video
* Code
* Data

### Types of Generative Models

* Text → Text
* Text → Image
* Image → Image
* Image → Video
* Text → Video
* Audio → Text
* And more

## 3. Deep Learning and Neural Networks

Generative AI is powered by:

* **Deep Learning**
* **Neural Networks**

These technologies enable machines to:

* Learn complex patterns
* Process large datasets
* Generate realistic and creative outputs

---

## 4. How Generative AI Develops Creativity

Generative AI uses advanced model architectures:

### 1. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

* Two neural networks compete to improve output quality.

### 2. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)

* Learn compressed representations of data and generate variations.

### 3. Transformers

* Use attention mechanisms.
* Power modern Large Language Models (LLMs).

### 4. Diffusion Models

* Generate data by gradually removing noise.
* Commonly used in image generation.
